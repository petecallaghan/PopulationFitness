# PopulationFitness

## Java Version

1. Install the latest JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
2. Install Maven (to build the Java project): https://maven.apache.org/install.html
3. To build the project run maven in the same directory as pom.xml (mvn)
4. The application has been developed using IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

###Building
To build using maven: 
* mvn package *Generates the JAR file (target\populationfitness.jar) after running all the tests*
* mvn package  -Dmaven.test.skip=true *Just generates the JAR file, without running tests*

### Running an Experiment
To run the main Java app:
* java -jar target/populationfitness.jar -s [seed] -t [csv file containing tuning] -e [csv file containing epochs]

For example:
* java -jar target\PopulationFitness.jar -s random -t Rosenbrock100.csv -e functionepochs-Rosenbrock-100.csv 

The *epoch* files are CSV format and can be generated by running methods from *uk.edu.populationfitness.tuning.TuneFunctionsTest*. An example is *functionepochs-SumOfPowers-100.csv*

The *tuning* files are CSV format, hand generated. Examples of tuning files include *sumsquarestuning.csv*

### Tuning 
To find out the fitness factor range for a fitness function, use *uk.edu.populationfitness.tuning.DiscoverFunctionRangeTest*. 

The fitness range is part of the tuning provided in the tuning CSV.
